# Diabetes Prediction System
Early diabetes prediction system for Sri Lankans using machine learning and retinopathy image detection.

- This system predict diabetes and diabetic retinopathy in early stages using machine learning and image processing.
- Two models were trained and used to get the diabetes and retinopathy predictions using two different datasets.
- Random forest algorithm and CNN algorithm used in these system models.
- python used as the main language for development.
- Tkinter, Keras, TensorFlow used as development frameworks. Tkinter used for the GUI.
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn used as libraries for the development.
- For the diabetes prediction model system trained using a Sri Lankan diabetes dataset that has been collected from Ragama hospital and for the retinopathy prediction system trained using a dataset taken from kaggle.
